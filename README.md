# Proxy Service for NestJS

This project provides a NestJS-based proxy server that modifies the text content of pages from specified websites. It is designed to:

- Add the "â„¢" symbol to each six-letter word on the pages.
- Ensure that the original site's functionality, including JavaScript, CSS, and images, remains intact.
- Redirect internal navigation links to the proxy server.

## Features

- Proxy server to fetch and modify web page content.
- Preserve JavaScript, CSS, and images functionality.
- Modify text content while preserving original site functionality.
- Redirect internal site links through the proxy server.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.x or later
- NestJS
- Puppeteer
- Jest for testing

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create a `.env` File**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Run the following command to start the NestJS application:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
The application will start a server, and you can access the proxy through the defined routes.

### Example Usage

To access a specific page such as `/websockets/gateways`, navigate to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/websockets/gateways
   ```
This will proxy and modify the content of `https://docs.nestjs.com/websockets/gateways`.


## Testing

Unit tests for the proxy service are written using Jest. To run the unit tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
